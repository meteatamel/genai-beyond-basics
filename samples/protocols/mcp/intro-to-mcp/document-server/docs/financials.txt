Corporate financials, also known as financial statements, are formal reports that provide a summary of a company's financial activities and performance over a specific period. These documents offer a detailed look into a company's financial health and are crucial for decision-making by various stakeholders, including investors, creditors, and management. The primary components of corporate financials are the income statement, balance sheet, cash flow statement, and statement of shareholders' equity.

Together, these financial statements provide a comprehensive view of a company's financial health, helping stakeholders to assess its profitability, stability, and overall performance. The income statement shows a company's revenues, expenses, and profits over a period of time. The balance sheet provides a snapshot of a company's financial position at a single point in time. The cash flow statement details the movement of cash into and out of a company. The statement of shareholders' equity shows the changes in a company's equity over a specific period.
