A product specification, often called a product spec or product requirements document (PRD), is a detailed document that outlines the requirements for a product or feature. It serves as a blueprint for product teams, including designers, developers, and other stakeholders, to ensure everyone is aligned on what is being built and why. The primary purpose of a product specification is to clearly communicate the product's purpose, features, functionality, and behavior.

While the exact contents can vary, a comprehensive product specification typically includes an introduction and summary, a business case, a description of the target audience and user personas, functional and technical requirements, user stories and use cases, design and UX/UI details, and any assumptions, constraints, and dependencies. In essence, a well-written product specification acts as a single source of truth for the entire team throughout the product development lifecycle, helping to align stakeholders and reduce ambiguity.
