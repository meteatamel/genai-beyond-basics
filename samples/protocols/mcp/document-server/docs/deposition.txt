A legal deposition is a formal, out-of-court testimony given by a witness under oath. It is a key part of the discovery process in a lawsuit, allowing both sides to gather information before a trial. The person giving the testimony is called the "deponent." The primary purpose of a deposition is to find out what a witness knows. This helps lawyers understand the facts of the case, evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of their arguments, and avoid surprises at trial. A deposition also creates a written record of a witness's testimony. This is crucial if a witness is unable to testify at the trial due to illness, death, or other reasons. The deposition transcript can be read or played in court and has the same legal force as live testimony.

A deposition typically takes place at a lawyer's office or a court reporter's office, not in a courtroom. The deponent, attorneys for all parties, and a court reporter are usually present. The court reporter administers an oath to the deponent, who swears to tell the truth. The attorney who requested the deposition begins questioning the witness, and then the other attorneys have an opportunity to ask questions. The entire proceeding is recorded by the court reporter, and sometimes it is also videotaped. After the deposition, the court reporter will produce a written transcript, which the deponent can review for accuracy.
