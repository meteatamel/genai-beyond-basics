A business report is a formal document that presents information and analysis on a specific business topic, such as sales performance, market trends, or project progress. Its primary purpose is to provide data-driven insights to stakeholders, enabling them to make informed decisions, track performance, and identify areas for improvement. Business reports are objective, structured, purpose-driven, and audience-focused.

There are numerous types of business reports, but they generally fall into two main categories: informational and analytical. Informational reports present facts and data without offering analysis or recommendations, while analytical reports interpret data, draw conclusions, and provide recommendations. Common types of business reports include financial reports, sales reports, marketing reports, progress reports, research reports, and annual reports. While the specific structure can vary, most business reports include a title page, executive summary, table of contents, introduction, body, conclusion, and recommendations.
