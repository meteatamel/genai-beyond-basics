A business plan is a formal, written document that outlines a company's goals, how it will achieve them, and the timeframe for doing so. It serves as a roadmap, providing direction for the business. The key purposes of a business plan are to provide strategic guidance, secure funding, and to clarify and focus the company's objectives. The process of writing a business plan forces you to think through all aspects of your business, clarifying your ideas and identifying potential roadblocks.

While the format can vary, most business plans include an executive summary, company description, market analysis, organization and management structure, a description of products and services, a marketing and sales strategy, and financial projections. There are two main types of business plans: the traditional business plan, which is a detailed and comprehensive document, and the lean startup plan, which is a high-level, one-page summary of the key elements of the business.
