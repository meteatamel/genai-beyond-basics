# A2A in Agent Development Kit (ADK)

An example that shows how to use A2A in ADK:

* [currency](./currency/) is an ADK agent exposed over A2A.
* [travel_helper](./travel_helper/) is an ADK agent using a local agent `weather_agent` and the remote agent `currency_agent`.

Follow instructions in each to get the sample working.
